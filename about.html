    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>I am a twenty-one year old girl living in Stockholm city. My name is Daniela but I prefer to be called Dani. I live together with my partner and our two cats. I spend my spare time watching TV-series, cuddling with my cats, working out and hanging out with my friends.</p>

    <h1>Web developing</h1>
    <p>Since a long time ago I’ve been interested in HTML and CSS. When I was 13 years old, I started my first blog. The blog's design was extremely boring and it was not suitable for a 13 year old girl. I began to read more about HTML and CSS so I could use the two ”languages” and change my blog’s design. Finally, the blog got the look I wanted and my friends discovered my newly acquired knowledge. The next couple of years I was asked by all my friends and friends’ friends to also fix their blogs.</p>

    <h1>Software developing</h1>
    <p>My interest in computer science grew and I wanted to learn more about it. In the spring of 2017, I studied a part-time course in Java programming while I still was working. When the course was completed, I wanted to learn more about programming and problem solving, which led to my apply for the UDM-program at Linnaeus University.</p>
